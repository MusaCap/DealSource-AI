# Product Requirements Document (PRD)  
**Product Name:** DealSource AI  
**Prepared for:** Musa Capital  
**Owner:** Allen Smith  
**Version:** Draft v1.0  

---

## 1. Objective
Build an autonomous agent that sources, evaluates, and recommends early-stage investment opportunities by leveraging **publicly available deal data** and **syndicate ecosystems**, while minimizing reliance on costly proprietary datasets.

---

## 2. Problem Statement
Deal sourcing for venture funds and angel investors is resource-intensive, relying on networks, conferences, and expensive databases (PitchBook, CB Insights). Many valuable signals exist in **publicly accessible channels** but are underutilized. A lightweight AI-driven sourcing engine could reduce costs, broaden coverage, and surface unique opportunities early.

---

## 3. Key Goals
- Aggregate deal flow from public and semi-public sources.  
- Provide structured company profiles with initial due diligence.  
- Score opportunities and generate a **preliminary investment recommendation**.  
- Enable easy integration into Musa Capital’s deal pipeline.  

---

## 4. Scope

### In-Scope
- **Data Sources**  
  - Crunchbase (free tiers + API)  
  - AngelList syndicates & rolling funds  
  - Y Combinator, Techstars, and other accelerator cohorts  
  - University/incubator demo day lists  
  - Conference speaker/attendee/registration lists (CES, Collision, AfroTech, etc.)  
  - Public LinkedIn data (growth signals, hiring trends)  
  - Twitter/X (announcements of launches, fundraising)  
  - Company websites & press releases  

- **Core Features**  
  - Data ingestion & normalization across sources.  
  - Company profile builder (team, product, market, funding stage).  
  - Initial diligence checks:  
    - Founding team background  
    - Market traction signals (users, customers, growth mentions)  
    - Sector mapping vs Musa Capital thesis  
    - Competitor landscape snapshot  
  - AI-generated recommendation (Invest / Track / Pass) with reasoning.  
  - Ranking & prioritization (e.g., “Top 10 weekly new deals”).  

- **Outputs**  
  - Weekly Deal Sourcing Report (auto-generated).  
  - Pipeline-ready company profiles (PDF/Notion/CRM export).  
  - Slack/email notifications for high-potential companies.  

### Out-of-Scope (for v1)

- Deep technical due diligence (requires expert analyst review).

- Direct outreach to startups (reserved for later automation).  

---

- **Partners** → Weekly prioritized list for pipeline meetings.  
- **Angel Syndicate Leads** → Discover co-investment opportunities.  
- **Corporate Scouts** → Monitor accelerator/demo day startups.  

---

## 6. Success Metrics

- **Relevance:** % of companies aligned with Musa Capital thesis.  
- **Adoption:** Weekly engagement with sourcing reports.  
- **Conversion:** # of sourced companies advancing to IC review.  

---

## 7. Technical Requirements
- **Architecture**  
  - Data ingestion layer (APIs + scraping pipelines).  
  - Storage: structured DB (Postgres/ElasticSearch).  
  - Processing: LLM-powered enrichment + scoring engine.  
  - Interface: web dashboard + Slack/email export.  

- **LLM Role**  
  - Summarize profiles.  
  - Compare startups against Musa Capital thesis.  
  - Generate structured recommendation (Invest/Track/Pass).  

- **Compliance**  
  - Respect ToS for APIs & scraping.  
  - Focus on public or opt-in data.  

---

## 8. Competitive Landscape
- PitchBook / CB Insights → expensive, lagging coverage.  
- Affinity / Dealroom → semi-proprietary signals.  
- DealSource AI differentiates by **focusing on public + early community signals**, capturing startups earlier in their journey.  

---

## 9. Roadmap (Phased Rollout)
**Phase 1 (MVP – 8 weeks)**  
- Integrate Crunchbase API, AngelList syndicates, YC/Techstars cohorts.  
- Generate weekly PDF/Slack reports.  
- Basic diligence scoring.  

**Phase 2 (Expansion – 3–6 months)**  
- Add LinkedIn hiring data + Twitter signals.  
- Conference attendee data ingestion.  
- Web dashboard with filters.  

**Phase 3 (Intelligence – 6–12 months)**  
- Predictive scoring (deal heat & probability of raising).  
- CRM integration (Affinity, Salesforce).  
- Outreach automation (warm intros, template generation).  

---

## 10. Risks & Mitigations
- **Data Reliability** → Cross-verify with multiple sources.  
- **Compliance Risk** → Avoid scraping restricted/private sources.  
- **Overload of irrelevant deals** → Tune filters & scoring to thesis.  
- **LLM hallucination** → Anchor on structured data, require analyst oversight.  

---

## 11. Open Questions
- Should the system allow direct founder contact (email/social scraping) in v2?  
- Do we integrate with Musa’s internal **scorecard framework** for continuity?  
- How often should refresh cycles run (daily vs weekly)?
